## [135. Candy](https://leetcode.cn/problems/candy/)

### Solution

- Use Greedy to solve the problem.
- Init: Given all of the children at least one candy.
  - From left to right: Execute that if one child's rating is more than his left child's then `add one`
  - From right to left: Execute that if one child's rating is more than his right child's then `add one` and take the max value between current value and new value.
- In case of violates the rule that `Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.` We need to compare both left and right side.

```java
class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int n = ratings.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];

        // each child will at least have one candy
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
        
        // from 0 to n-1
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]) dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 1;
        }

        // from n-2 to 0
        for(int i=n-2;i>=0;i--){
            if(ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]) dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[i+1]+1);
        }
        
        // sum and return 
        return Arrays.stream(dp).reduce(0, Integer::sum);
    }
}
```
