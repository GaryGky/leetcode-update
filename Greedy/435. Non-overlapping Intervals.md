## [435. Non-overlapping Intervals](https://leetcode.cn/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

### Solution

**Greedy**

- Sorted by **end asc and start desc**.

- Enumerate from 0 to n-1

  - When found a non-overlapping interval, record its end point;
  - When found a overlapping interval, `cnt++`

  By this means (mostly by the sorting strategy), we can minimize the non-overlapping interval's span and find the minimum number of removal.

**Similar Problem**: 

[Candy](./135. Candy) where we first consider assign candy from left to right and then from right to left.

[Reconstruct queue by height](406. Queue Reconstruction by Height) where we first consider the **K** value and then the **H** value.

```java
class Solution {
    private final int start = 0, end = 1;
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        // sort
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (iv1, iv2) -> {
            if(iv1[end] != iv2[end]) return iv1[end] - iv2[end];
            return iv2[start] - iv1[start];
        });

        // count
        int cnt = 0;
        int lastEnd = intervals[0][end];
        for(int i=1;i<intervals.length;i++){
            if(intervals[i][start] < lastEnd) {
                cnt++;
                continue;
            }else{
                lastEnd = intervals[i][end];
            }
        }
        return cnt;
    }
}
