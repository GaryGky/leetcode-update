## [1109. Counting Flight](https://leetcode.cn/problems/corporate-flight-bookings/)

The algorithm within this problem is called Diff Array, where each element in diffArray is like:
$$
b(i)=\left\{\begin{aligned}  & a[i] - a[i-1], i > 0 \\ & a[0], i=0 \\\end{aligned}\right.
$$
And for each incoming booking (first, last, seat), we can denote this element as increase seat from first to last. Considering this, we will first construct a diff array based on the given booking list. Then we can reconstruct the original array which is the booking seats for each flight with the diff array by:

```java
a[i] = b[i] + a[i-1]
```

Based on the analysis above, we can handle this problem by a really simple implementation.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] corpFlightBookings(int[][] bookings, int n) {
        int[] b = new int[n];
        for(int[] book : bookings){
            int l = book[0]-1, r = book[1], inc = book[2];
            b[l] += inc;
            if(r<n) b[r] -= inc;
        }

        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            b[i] += b[i-1];
        }
        return b;
    }
}
```
